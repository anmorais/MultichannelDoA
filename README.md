# MultichannelDoA

Python project for multichannel direction of arrival (description here : https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/multichannel-doa-estimation/)

The final report is the file MultichannelDOA_report_AM.pdf. The code is in the notebook files. 

The first algorithm talked (white noise localization) is implemented in the WhiteNoiseLocalisationSecondTestNoVoters and WhiteNoiseLocalisationOmnidirectional-freqTry other stuff were attempts, still interesting to keep 

The music algorithm uses the different Music-severalFreq files 

and the attempt to pyroomacoustics is in the pyroomacoustics directory



Other directories are mainly for data retrieved.
